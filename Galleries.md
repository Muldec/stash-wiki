Stash offers support for image galleries.
Here are some remarks on using them:

- **Galleries are zip-folders with images (e.g. jpeg or png) in them.**
- Stash searches for zip galleries in the same paths it searches for videos.
- If you want to add a gallery to a scene, make sure that the zip file and the video file are in the same folder.
- Stash always reads image files directly from the zip files. With huge images, this can be slow and cause visual errors in the ui.
