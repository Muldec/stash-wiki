Stash plugins add further features that Stash doesn't itself provide.

To install a plugin, save them to `%USERPROFILE%\.stash\plugins` on Windows or `/root/.stash/plugins` on Unix systems (Mac, Linux, etc.). The `plugins` directory won't exist by default so you will have to create it. Once installed, go to the Plugins page in your Stash settings and reload plugins.
